Object oriented programming
----------------------------

Object oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm using the concept of "**object**". Those objects can represent a concept, an idea or an entity of the physical world. An object contains data (attributs/properties) and code (methods). Methods can access or sometimes modify the fields and objects can interact with each other.

This way of programming also allows to use **classes**. They define the data format and which procedure are available for a given class of object. They can contain data and class methods too.

Why use OOP: to concept, maintain and develop heavy softwares.

Advantages of OOP:

- modularity
- abstraction
- reusability
- safety
- encapsulation
