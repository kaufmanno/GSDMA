Description
===========


This project of geospatial data management and analysis supervised by Mr Kaufmann consists of displaying data extracted on a polluted industrial site in 2D and 3D in order to have a good representation of the composition of the soil. These data are about the lythology of boreholes realised on the polluted site and g√©ophysics results such as resistivity mesured by some electrodes. 

Firstly, the program start from the boreholes description given by .txt files. Those data are gathered into a SQLite database, in a specific organization, in 4 tables : Boreholes - Components - Intervals - Lexicon, with the format of Geopackage, which is a format for geospatial information.

Then, the data are read and put into a specific structure called Striplog.

Finally, from the striplog structure the data are displaying in 2D (using Striplog package) and in 3D (using PyVista package).
